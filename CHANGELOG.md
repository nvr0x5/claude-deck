# Changelog

## 0.3.2

- New collapsed look: `/deck collapsed text` shows one plain status line (limits, context, task, route, weather, clock). `/deck collapsed chips` keeps the mini bars.
- Two demos in the README, desktop and terminal, both drawn with Deck's own code and ending on the collapsed line.
- The test workflow asks for read-only access; added SECURITY.md.

## 0.3.1

- Agents started without a todo list now show as strips under the activity bar, with their model, like the demo.
- Both usage limits stay on screen when Claude Code reports only one window in an update.
- Bar titles show the words you typed, without system reminders or pasted blocks.
- The model route row no longer draws the confidence over the history squares.
- Agent names no longer run into their status in the strips.
- The terminal pet keeps a small margin from the band's right edge.
- The pet's lane is taller, so jumps aren't clipped.
- `/deck`, `/deck expand` and `/deck collapse` always reply.
- Tests run on every push (GitHub Actions).

## 0.3.0
